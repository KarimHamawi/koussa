we need this information:
attached cifs are related to agent on proxies.
need a report to extract the linked accountholder (principal) CIF.
then need below fields related to the principal only:
• Has active account (yes/no)
• Deceased (yes/no)
• Poa status
• Proxy type
• Proxy issue date
• Poa validity


DECEASED is in STTM_CUSTOMER
this is for has active account: nvl( ( select distinct 'YES' from sttm_cust_ACCOUNT@BMLB_LNK where record_stat='O' and cust_no=cu.customer_no),'NO')  HAS_OPEN_ACCOUNT,
these for poa:
nvl((select distinct 'YES' from STTM_CUST_POA_CUSTOM@BMLB_LNK  where CUSTOMER_NO = cu.customer_no) ,'NO')has_POA,
nvl((select distinct 'YES' from STTM_CUST_POA_CUSTOM@BMLB_LNK  where POA_AGENT_ID = cu.customer_no) ,'NO')IS_POA_AGENT,
POA_STAT is in STTM_CUST_POA_CUSTOM
poa_validity is in STTM_CUST_POA_CUSTOM
PROXY_TYPE is in STTM_CUST_POA_CUSTOM
poa_issue_date is in STTM_CUST_POA_CUSTOM (maybe can use for proxy issue date)

STTM_CUST_POA_CUSTOM has customer_no prim key, same for STTM_CUSTOMER, same for STTM_CUST_POA_CUSTOM
finally, the cifs theyre talking about are in this table:
CITIZEN_TABLE with cols seq and citizen_id
also, add these conditions to the query:
STTM_CUSTOMER.record_stat = 'O'
STTM_CUST_ACCOUNT.record_stat = 'O'
